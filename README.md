# stochastic-algorithms-for-biology
The aim is to present a new approach to the Monte Carlo algorithm comparing its computational cost to the one of the classical and the Gillespie algorithm showing that the order is preserved. 

The file names ending with the word 'fast' implement the new approach to the Monte Carlo algorithm.
The file names ending with the word 'slow' implement the classical algorithm. 
The file names ending with the word 'slow' implement the Gillespie algorithm.

In the folder 'competition' we present the classical and new approach to the Monte Carlo algorithm for a competition model either with one or two species in the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. In the folder 'predatorPrey' we implement also the Gillespie algorithm. 

The folder 'comparison' contains the comparison in terms of computational costs between the classical, the new and the Gillespie approach for the predator-prey model and it shows that the order of the new approach is equal to the one of the classical Monte Carlo algorithms.
